Our system interacts with Canvas through its API, using a personal access token generated by the admin account. This token acts as a password, enabling the system to retrieve and input data directly into Canvas. To import outcomes into different courses, find the 'import_outcomes.py' Python file and 'outcome_import_CSV_files' folder. Each .csv file within this folder contains outcome data for specific courses. An example .csv file is provided for reference. Run the script by providing the API personal access token and the API link to your school's Canvas API. If unsure about the course number, find it in the course shell URL. Running this script connects to the Canvas API, importing outcomes directly into the respective courses.
