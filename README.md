ABET Server Guide

The ABET Server is designed to streamline and expedite the ABET evaluation process for instructors, minimizing stress and time consumption. As most schools, including ours, utilize Canvas for course storage, integrating our system with Canvas seemed logical. Leveraging Canvas outcomes, which allow the creation of diverse outcomes linked directly to assignments, was key. To gain a better understanding of Canvas and its outcomes, refer to informative videos provided below. Additionally, we've established a special Admin account with access to all courses involved in the ABET evaluation process.
